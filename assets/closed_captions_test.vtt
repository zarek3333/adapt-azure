process, known as Saputo Connect.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.428
Rooted in our Grow in Your Own Way mindset,

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.452
Saputo Connect offers a structured process

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:12.452 --> 00:00:15.289

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.930
your development top of mind.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.186
It consists of three key elements:

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.522
setting individual business goals,

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.271
creating Individual Development

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:27.776
Plans and engaging in quality

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:30.650
conversations with your one-up leader.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.066
This module - Module 1 - focuses on setting

NOTE Confidence: 0.84418694

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.880
individual business goals. Ready?

NOTE Confidence: 0.91789622625

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.820
Let's start by defining what a goal is:

NOTE Confidence: 0.89975447625

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.064
A goal is something you want to accomplish.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909197518

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.860
Why do we set goals?

NOTE Confidence: 0.909197518

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.730
Here are a few reasons:

NOTE Confidence: 0.909197518

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.030
Goals give us purpose;

NOTE Confidence: 0.909197518

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.330
Achieving goals is rewarding;

NOTE Confidence: 0.909197518

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.570
Goals keep us motivated when

NOTE Confidence: 0.909197518

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.039
challenges arise; and goals clarify

NOTE Confidence: 0.909197518

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.608
expectations and priorities.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.414
We set departmental goals at work to

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:10.729
achieve our collective success at Saputo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.285
We set individual business goals

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:14.429
at work to perform well in our

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.025
current role and to align our

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:17.620
efforts and contributions with

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.620
business priorities and objectives.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.840
When you set your goals,

NOTE Confidence: 0.831791931538462

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.080
make sure they're SMART.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.032
What's a SMART goal?

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:26.032 --> 00:01:28.470
SMART is a formula for writing goals,

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.120
not a goal in itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.808
SMART is a formula to write goals precisely

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.338
so you'll have a clear path to follow

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:37.448
with specific parameters that help keep

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:40.130
you accountable and on track to succeed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.390
SMART stands for Specific, Measurable,

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.214
Achievable, Relevant, and Timely.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:48.214 --> 00:01:52.038
Specific means be precise.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.280
Describe what you will

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.830
do to complete the goal;

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.898
Identify the resources needed;

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.715
Measurable means quantifiable.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:02.740
Identify the criteria for success;

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.252
Use precise numbers, quantities,

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:05.252 --> 00:02:09.140
hours, percentages, etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.628
Achievable means realistic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:12.116
Challenge yourself and

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:14.840
aim high, but not too high.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.633
Put a reasonable timeframe in place; and

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:20.664
identify what you may need to succeed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.926
For example, resources, prep

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:25.054
work, knowledge, skills,

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:25.054 --> 00:02:28.964
authority, support and so on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.335
Relevant means meaningful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:33.520
...Meaningful to you and to the business.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.740
Clarify how your individual business

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.516
goal contributes to department

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:40.160
goals; and connect this goal to

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.948
Saputo's Global Strategic Plan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.806
Timely means Time-bound.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:47.126
Hold yourself accountable with deadlines

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:49.607
and milestones to track progress.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.592
Assign a target date or dates

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:54.083
to keep accountable. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.514
Now you're ready to set individual

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:56.514 --> 00:02:59.159
business goals using the SMART formula.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.048
But first...

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:02.268
setting your goals starts with

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:04.040
understanding your department's goals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.720
If you haven't done so already,

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.700
discuss departmental goals with your leader

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.440
along with how you will contribute

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.600
to the team's success.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.595
Then use the SMART formula to write

NOTE Confidence: 0.855935487272727

00:03:12.595 --> 00:03:13.790
your individual business goals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.398
Let's look at Step 1 more

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.218
closely and how it could play out...

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.614
Step 1 is to ask your leader

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:24.100
to share departmental goals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.915
Discuss how those goals connect

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:27.748
to Saputo's global strategic plan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:27.748 --> 00:03:29.583
Determine how you will contribute

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:31.519
to reaching departmental goals

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.300
and align with your leader

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.368
on your priorities.

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.348
During the conversation

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.630
you learn that one of the goals

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:37.694 --> 00:03:39.956
for your department is to... Improve

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:41.464
the overall customer satisfaction

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.260

NOTE Confidence: 0.872647168461539

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.780
10% by the end of fiscal year.

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.324
Now for Step 2.

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:03:49.324 --> 00:03:51.008
Considering your departmental goals,

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.810
set an individual business goal

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.610
for yourself using the SMART

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:56.297
formula to outline details.

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.472
Given the example we discussed, where

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:00.423
the departmental goal was: ...Improve

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:02.435
the overall customer satisfaction

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:04.447

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:07.980

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.518
Let's see an example of our

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:04:10.518 --> 00:04:11.787
employee's individual business

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:13.890

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.929
Now, let's check if it is SMART.

NOTE Confidence: 0.773916855

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.261
It's now time to examine the individual

00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:51.786
